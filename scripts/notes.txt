Experiments
================
sppal02 - Resnet34 on aligned crops
sppal03 - Shufflnet medium
sppal04 - Resnet34 - just take 4 frames

spp08 - lots of augmentation
spp11 - variable sized images; reduce spatial pooling to (1, 2) and (1, 2, 4)
spp12 - reproduce spp08
spp13 - Cosine LR schdule ~20 epochs
spp14 - Resnet50
spp15 - Seresnext
spp17 - Resnet50 with masking of LSTM output
spp18 - Resnet50 with masking & lookahead
spp19 - Resnet50 spp14 with on 1) pose images 2) variable centered
spp20 - Resnet50 spp17 with on 1) pose images 2) variabble centered
spp21 - Resnet50 spp19 with crop faces
spp22 - Resnet34 with 4FPS
spp23 - Resnte34 2FPS & 4FPS with limited pooling (1,2)
spp24 - SeResnext 2FPS & 4FPS with limited pooling (1,2)
spp25 - Resnte34 2FPS & 4FPS with limited pooling (1,2) /// New val
spp26 - SeResnext dual loss
spp27 - Copy spp24 - Frames from different videos
spp28 - Copy spp24 - reduce augmentation
spp29 - Mixnet_l
spp30 - Mixnet30 with frames from other vids
spp31 - Mixnet_xl low aug, and take other frames
spp32 - Mixnet xl low aug, no other frames, 5 fold
spp33 - Efficientnet b1 & b2 ns; copy from spp32
spp34 - Efficientnet b1 ns; test best combination of other frames
spp35 - Efficientnet b2 ns - 5 fold
spp36 - Efficientnet b2 ns - 5 fold
spp37 - Frame diff
spp38 - Efficientnet b1 ns - 5 fold
spp39 - Copy spp32 and learn on objects

tsm01 - TSM Base and with LSTM at end
tsm02 - TSM Base parallelised
tsm03 - TSM on SeResNext
tsm04 - TSM Base, blockres fold_div 4
tsm06 - Take 2 FPS
tsm07 - tune dropout

Ideas 
========
*** Error analysis on face size and error - and real vs fake
*** Zero embeddings of blank image
Inference - video start and end for batch size 1
Use try and except for the gpu part of previous point
More aug to Real images
Add simple features paper
Try zoom augmentation
*** Resnet50 face tracker at inference
ImgDiff model
Add audio features
Seresnext on TSM
*** Start with more easier samples (larger faces) and gradually move to more difficult. 
Add pose to the model - part of retinaface now
Extract yaw, ptich; and choose frames which minimise this
Add face box size to model
Optical flow in TSM
Center crop and random crop
