Experiments
================
spp08 - lots of augmentation
spp11 - variable sized images; reduce spatial pooling to (1, 2) and (1, 2, 4)
spp12 - reproduce spp08
spp13 - Cosine LR schdule ~20 epochs
spp14 - Resnet50
spp15 - Seresnext
spp17 - Resnet50 with masking of LSTM output
spp18 - Resnet50 with masking & lookahead
spp19 - Resnet50 spp14 with on pose images
spp20 - Resnet50 spp17 with on pose images

tsm01 - TSM Base and with LSTM at end
tsm02 - TSM Base parallelised
tsm03 - TSM on SeResNext
tsm04 - TSM Base, blockres fold_div 4

Ideas 
========
*** Error analysis on face size and error - and real vs fake
*** Zero embeddings of blank image
Inference - video start and end for batch size 1
Use try and except for the gpu part of previous point
More aug to Real images
Add simple features paper
*** Resnet50 face tracker at inference
ImgDiff model
Add audio features
Seresnext on TSM
Start with more easier samples (larger faces) and gradually move to more difficult. 
Add pose to the model - part of retinaface now
Extract yaw, ptich; and choose frames which minimise this
Add face box size to model
Optical flow in TSM
Center crop and random crop
