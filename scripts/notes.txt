Experiments
================
spp08 - lots of augmentation
spp11 - variable sized images; reduce spatial pooling to (1, 2) and (1, 2, 4)
spp12 - reproduce spp08
spp13 - Cosine LR schdule ~20 epochs
spp14 - Resnet50
spp15 - Seresnext

tsm01 - TSM Base and with LSTM at end
tsm02 - TSM Base parallelised
tsm03 - TSM on SeResNext
tsm04 - TSM Base, blockres fold_div 4

To try
========
Error analysis on face size and error - and real vs fake
Zero embeddings of blank image
Inference - video start and end for batch size 1
More aug to Real images
Resnet50 face tracker at inference
Seresnext on TSM
