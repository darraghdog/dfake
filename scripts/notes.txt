Experiments
================
spp08 - lots of augmentation
spp11 - variable sized images; reduce spatial pooling to (1, 2) and (1, 2, 4)
spp12 - reproduce spp08
spp13 - Cosine LR schdule ~20 epochs
spp14 - Resnet50
spp15 - Seresnext
spp17 - Resnet50 with masking of LSTM output
spp18 - Resnet50 with masking & lookahead

tsm01 - TSM Base and with LSTM at end
tsm02 - TSM Base parallelised
tsm03 - TSM on SeResNext
tsm04 - TSM Base, blockres fold_div 4
packet_write_wait: Connection to 10.176.24.95 port 22: Broken pipe

========
*** Error analysis on face size and error - and real vs fake
*** Zero embeddings of blank image
Inference - video start and end for batch size 1
Use try and except for the gpu part of previous point
More aug to Real images
Add simple features paper
*** Resnet50 face tracker at inference
ImgDiff model
Add audio features
Seresnext on TSM
Add pose to the model - part of retinaface now
Add face box size to model
